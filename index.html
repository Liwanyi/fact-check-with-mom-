                        Augustine Lisha Xu did not expect to become an Australian permanent resident within just two years of applying for it from overseas.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The 35-year-old, Lisha Xu, lodged his subclass 175, Skilled-Independent visa application, from mainland China in 2009, which would give him permanent residency in Australia.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He was informed the average processing time for the 175 visas would be four years, so he was pleasantly surprised when he was granted permanent residency in 2011.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “<big>I</big> got a shock when I received my permanent residency. I did not expect it to be granted that quickly and was even nervous that I had become someone who’s associated with Australia, a country I had only visited a couple times before,” Mr Xu said.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Before becoming an Australian permanent resident, this Chinese national had never lived in Australia other than visiting some relatives and friends.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Australia’s immigration policies were affected by the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, when skilled job positions plummeted and the Federal Government, led by the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, tightened its intake of skilled migrants.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                        <i class="mb-0">"It was becoming pretty tough for skilled migrants after the financial crisis in 2008."</i>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        “When many Australian people were unemployed and the government wanted to put Australians first in employment. It took much longer than before to process visa applications, especially in the skilled migration stream.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “And Australian government continues its ‘Australians first’ policy to this day,” Mr Xu said.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Between 2008 and 2009, the Rudd government undertook <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/2012-2013/SkilledMigration">a review of permanent skilled migration</a>, which identified the need for a shift in the focus away from supply-driven independent skilled migration to demand-driven migration, in terms of government and employer-sponsored skilled migration policy.
                    </p>

                                    <p>Mr Xu’s desirable skills and work experiences in information technology (IT) both contribute to his eligible application for Australian permanent residency. </p>

                                    <p>
                                            To be eligible to apply for permanent residency under the Skilled-Independent stream, the applicant needs to meet requirements such as three years’ minimum work experience in the relevant field, under 50 years of age, competent English ability and occupation assessment.
                                        </p>

                    <p>
                        With a university degree in <span class="bold">computer science and technology</span class="bold"> from China, Mr Xu had worked as a system developer for Sony in Japan for two years and worked in IT in China for a number of years, making him a desirable candidate for the Skilled-Independent visa stream as IT professionals were considered to be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.employment.gov.au/national-state-and-territory-skill-shortage-information">in critical shortage in Australia</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Furthermore, from January 1, 2009, the Federal Government announced that skilled migrants sponsored by an employer were given higher processing priority than independent migrants, which was also against Mr Xu. </p>

                    <p>
                        It seems like the number of migrants intake had been cut by the government, these changes did have an evident negative impact on Mr Xu.

                    <p>
                         When <span class="bold">Julia Gillard</span class="bold"> became Prime Minister in 2010, she vowed to implement <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1516/OverseasStudents">stricter immigration policies</a> and would extend processing for skilled permanent residency applications to up to 10 years.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ms Gillard said the government would <a target="_blank" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-06/gillard-on-skills-shortage/3317442">prioritise Australians</a> to fill skills shortage and would train the unemployed to meet demands in areas such as mining before skilled migrants were brought in.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ms Gillard told <a target="_blank" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-06/gillard-on-skills-shortage/3317442">ABC Radio National</a>.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                        <i class="mb-0">"We don't want to leave a kid in Kwinana in Western Australia on the unemployment queue without skills while the people who operate big mines in the north-west of the state say can you import a plumber or a cook or an electrician for me,"</i>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        "I want that kid to get that opportunity."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Gillard government also revised the Labor party’s position on asylum seeker policy and re-opened offshore detention</a> centres for asylum seekers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Her rationale behind the stricter immigration policy was to make sure the Australian population growth was sustainable.
                    </p>

                    <p>Ms Gillard justified her <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2010/07/06/full-transcript-gillards-asylum-policy-speech">response to asylum seekers</a> by saying: “We are taking these steps in response to the increase in unauthorised people movements in our region and around the world.”</p>

                    <p>“The purpose would be to ensure that people smugglers have no product to sell. Arriving by boat would just be a ticket back to the regional processing centre,” she explained the reason for building offshore detention centres for illegal arrivals by boat.</p>

                    <p>Mr Xu felt the pressure from the Gillard government to reform Australia’s immigration policy and control the intake of immigrants.</p>

                    <p>“People who were eager to migrate to Australia at the time were quite stressed because they knew the Gillard government was trying to make it more difficult to migrate,” he said. </p>

                    <p>Comparing his personal migration experience to that of asylum seekers, he said he was appalled by the government’s treatment of asylum seekers. </p>

                    <p>“As a skilled migrant, even though I was anxious that I wouldn’t get the permanent residency, I was at least living a standard life in China. I even bought an apartment in southern China because I thought I might not get permanent residency in Australia and I was going to live in China for the foreseeable future,” Mr Xu said. </p>

                    <p>
                        “But asylum seekers risk their lives coming to Australia. They come here to have a better life but they are turned away by the government and sent to detention centres in other countries that they did not want to go to,” he said.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <i class="mb-0">“Julia Gillard’s policy was much harsher on asylum seekers than skilled migrants.” </i>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>In addition, Gillard’s ongoing commitment to reform the skilled migration, intended to further target the employer sponsored category, cut the number of general skilled migration. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.acacia-au.com/new-skilled-occupations-list-July-2011.php">New Skilled Occupation List (SOL) list</a> came into effect on July 1 2011 and offered more intake of IT professionals and accountants. </p>

                    <p>Although having met all the requirements, he still did not have high hopes to get permanent residency. </p>

                    <p>“My life was pretty much the same as usual after I applied,” he said.</p>

                    <p>Fortunately, he was informed that he had become a permanent resident two years later. </p>

                    <p>The immigration policy “opened up again” and skilled migration became easier during the period of 2011-2013, showing relaxation in the immigration policy under the Gillard government, despite Ms Gillard’s initial promise to reduce the number of immigrants. </p>

                        <p>At present, the skilled migration intake ceiling for 2017-2018 is 190,000, while the government has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.border.gov.au/WorkinginAustralia/Pages/1-July-2017-changes.aspx">abolished</a> the 457-skilled temporary worker visa in a crackdown on skilled migrants. </p>

                        <p>Xu was enjoying his new life in Australia and considered immigration was vital for the development of a country like Australia, because immigration can appeal to foreign investment, attract foreign talents and elites to the country and establish the country’s international reputation. </p>



                        <p>Immigrants like Xu have played a big role in Australia's history. They've made society more multi-cultural and brought their traditions to our country to enjoy.</p>

                        <p>“It is beneficial to the country to a controllable extent.”</p>
